# Heartflow Support System

This repository contains the code for a website that acts as a support system for the non-profit organization, Heartflow, based in Cape Town, South Africa. The website was built using the Django backend framework, PostgreSQL database, and React for the frontend.

The goal of the website is to support the work of Heartflow's volunteers, who sell coupons to the general public that can be donated to homeless individuals. These coupons can then be redeemed at homeless shelters in exchange for services such as a night's stay or food.

The website allows volunteers to log deliveries at companies, such as grocery stores, register new companies, delete companies, log pick-ups of coupons, exchange coupons with other volunteers, and report lost coupons.

## Features

- Logging deliveries at companies
- Registering new companies
- Deleting companies
- Logging pick-ups of coupons

## Getting Started

The website is hosted online using Heroku and can be accessed at [heartflow-support-system.herokuapp.com](heartflow-support-system.herokuapp.com)

If you would like to run the website locally, you can clone the repository and set up a virtual environment. Then, install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Next, set up the PostgreSQL database using the settings in the `settings.py` file.

Finally, run the development server by running the command `python manage.py runserver`.
